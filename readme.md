# EXT-Pages (aska MMM-pages v2) - Extented for `MMM-GoogleAssistant` v5.x

This [MagicMirror²][mm²] Module allows you to have animated pages in your magic mirror!<br>
Want to have more modules in your magic mirror, but want to keep the format?<br>
Or, want to have grouped modules that are themed together? Look no further!<br>

![Example](example.webp)

Note that this module does not provide any method of manually changing the page!<br>
You should ask other developers to add a notification to their modules, or add
one yourself!

Naturally, you can use it as a single module and without `MMM-GoogleAssistant`
